<!--Place form content within .navbar-form for proper vertical alignment and collapsed behavior in narrow viewports. Use the alignment options to decide where it resides within the navbar content.

As a heads up, .navbar-form shares much of its code with .form-inline via mixin. Some form controls, like input groups, may require fixed widths to be show up properly within a navbar.-->

<form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search">
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Search">
  </div>
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">Submit</button>
</form>
